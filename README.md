# Community-Chat-Web-Application
Created a dynamic community chat web application using the Flask framework and Replit features. This web app allows guests to view the chat, but admins (authenticated through replit) can post, and certain individuals can edit the chat as well. Implemented app routing to allow users to navigate the web application and perform various tasks.
